### Documentation

#### 1. **Installation and Imports**
   - **Purpose:** Installs necessary libraries (`face_recognition` and `deepface`) and imports required modules.
   - **Code:**
     ```python
     !pip install face_recognition
     !pip install deepface

     import os
     import glob
     from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     from deepface import DeepFace
     import cv2
     import dlib
     import numpy as np
     ```

#### 2. **Helper Functions**
   - **Cosine Similarity Calculation:**
     - **Function:** `cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)`
     - **Purpose:** Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors, used to measure similarity between face embeddings.
   
   - **Face Alignment:**
     - **Function:** `align_face(image_path)`
     - **Purpose:** Aligns the face in the input image using dlib's landmarks detector, which helps improve recognition accuracy.
   
   - **Image Preprocessing:**
     - **Function:** `preprocess_image(image_path)`
     - **Purpose:** Aligns, resizes, converts to grayscale, and normalizes images to prepare them for embedding generation.
   
   - **Display Images:**
     - **Function:** `display_images(test_image_path, matched_image_path, name, similarity)`
     - **Purpose:** Displays test and matched images side-by-side using Matplotlib for visual comparison.

#### 3. **Main Functionalities**
   - **Facial Search:**
     - **Function:** `facial_search(image_to_test, known_faces, known_face_names, models=['VGG-Face', 'Facenet'])`
     - **Purpose:** Compares a test image against known faces using embeddings from the specified models. Displays the matched image if a match is found above a set similarity threshold.

   - **Adding New Faces:**
     - **Function:** `add_to_training(image_path, known_faces, known_face_names)`
     - **Purpose:** Adds a new face image to the known faces training set, generates embeddings, and updates the saved data files.

#### 4. **Main Script Execution**
   - **Purpose:** Handles the main logic, including loading existing known faces, allowing users to upload new images for training, and processing test images for facial recognition.
   - **Key Steps:**
     1. Loads saved embeddings and face names.
     2. Allows users to upload images for training.
     3. Adds the uploaded images to the training set.
     4. Allows users to upload test images and runs the facial search function to find matches.

### Conclusion
our code provides an end-to-end implementation of a facial recognition system using `DeepFace` and `dlib`. It includes functionalities for face alignment, image preprocessing, similarity calculation, training data updates, and facial search with visual feedback on matched images.
